# DSA Project Assignment

Welcome to the DSA Project Assignment repository! This repository contains the final project for my Data Structures class. The project is implemented entirely in C++ and showcases various data structures and algorithms learned throughout the course.

## Project Overview

This project was created as a final assignment for my Data Structures class. The goal was to apply the concepts and techniques we learned to solve a complex problem using efficient data structures and algorithms.

## Features

- **Efficient Algorithms**: Implemented various algorithms to solve the problem efficiently.
- **Data Structures**: Utilized multiple data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
- **Modular Code**: Organized the code into modules for better readability and maintenance.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and compile the C++ files using your preferred compiler.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nexusameer/DSA-PROJECT-ASSIGNMENT.git
cd DSA-PROJECT-ASSIGNMENT
g++ -o project main.cpp
./project
